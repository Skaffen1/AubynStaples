<H1>Aubyn Warner Staples Diary</H1>
  Aged around 24 years old? <br>
<br>
This diary was written in 1938 in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.  <br>
Attitudes back then were very different, where these are offensive   <br>
I will try remove them but will try keep as much of the original     <br>
content as possible for the sake of authenticity.                    <br>
These views are NOT my own, I am trying to keep a bit of history alive.  <br>

  wet and gave trouble in the Culvert.  <br>
