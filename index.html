3rd January 1938 - Monday     <u>Fine day warm</u>   <br>
  Went spearing last night at Oyster Rocks - got   <br>
  1 Kolstert and 11 springers. Today went up to Claytons   <br>
  Rock's with Palmer crowd. After a days fishing got   <br>
  2 high waters, which I gave to Owen Pike.   <br>
  Bait was plentify. Spent the evening   <br>
  playing Monoply with Eric and the boys   <br>
  down at Jocks.   <br>
<br>
4th January 1938 Tuesday     Rather hot.   <br>  
  Went up to Claytons Rocks with the   <br>
  Palmer crowd. Fished all day but   <br>
  without success. Doreen Ray & I went   <br>
  to watch the children playing games on   <br>
  the sand hills. Oh boy, can the rising   <br>
  generation kiss?   <br>
    Dad broke his rod.   <br>
<br>
5th January 1938 Wednesday   <br>
  Dad's birthday. Brink, Jock, Dad & I   <br>
  left the Kleinemond this morning at 7 for   <br>
  home in Merricks V8.  At 'Comfort'   <br>
  I got onto my bike and rode via   <br>
  Bathurst to 'Curries Drift'. Stopped for a   <br>
  short while at Willmores & had tea.   <br>
  Our turn for <u>Dip</u> again.   <br>
  Got a letter from Rosemary.   <br>
  Boys getting pine plants out of Willmores   <br>
  ground.   <br>
  Back to Kleinemond in the afternoon -    <br>
  played bridge. Jerripico & bed.   <br>
<br>
6th January 1938     <u>Clear - Nasty Cold West Wind</u>
  Reid River boys played Kleinemonde, Cricket   <br>
  and were beaten. Watching was scant   <br>
  pleasure though since there seemed to be   <br>
  a regular sand storm. Altogether it   <br>
  was a rotten day.<br>
<br>
7th January 1938     <u>Fine Day. Rather Warm.</u>
  Started the day on Monoply up at S.Timms.   <br>
  Then we went down to Jock's boat and   <br>
  tested the engine. Eventually got it going   <br>
  O.K.. then we got bait - had lunch, and   <br>
  after several delays. Brink, Jock, Sharkey, Jimmy   <br>
  Peter, Beaut & myself went up the river.   <br>
  Sharkey caught a 6lb Cob on his river Line.   <br>
                                          Prawn.<br>
<br>
** Cob? more likely to be a cod - D's often changed to B's in original.
** Jan Bruins - a kind of fish.<br>
** Jerripico - some sort of South African wine?<br>
