<H1>Aubyn Warner Staples Diary</H1>
  Aged around 24 years old? <br>
<br>
This diary was written in 1938 in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.  <br>
Attitudes back then were very different, where these are very        <br>
offensive I will try remove them but will try keep as much of the    <br>
original content as possible for the sake of authenticity.           <br>
These views are NOT my own, I am trying to keep a bit of history alive.  <br>
