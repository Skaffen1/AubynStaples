<H1>Aubyn Warner Staples Diary</H1>
  Aged around 24 years old? <br>
<br>
This diary was written in 1938 in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.  <br>
Attitudes back then were very different, where these are offensive   <br>
I will try remove them but will try keep as much of the original     <br>
content as possible for the sake of authenticity.                    <br>
These views are NOT my own, I am trying to keep a bit of history alive.  <br>

1st February 1938 Tuesday     Hot.  <br>
  Planting pines. Pushing hard.  <br>
  Nothing of great interest has  <br>
  happened today.  Women   <br>
  are loafing badly.  James  <br>
  harrowed the mealies in   <br>
  the orchard.   <br>
<br>
2nd February 1938 Wednesday     Hot day. Slight rain PM.   <br>
  Still planting pines. Jacks oxen are <br>
  ploughing just ahead of the planting <br>
  and Jonash's oxen are riding on <br>
  plants.  I made a hard push <br>
  today.  In the afternoon I took the <br>
  tractor up to the land and ploughed <br>
  out the ends.  A heavy thunder <br>
  storm fell near Grahamstown  <br>
  but did not quite reach us. We   <br>
  got just enough to quit work.   <br>
  <u>3 boys from AGP!</u>  <br>
<br>
3rd February 1938 Thursday     Warm.  <br>
  Still planting pines as fast as I  <br>
  can - rushing in fact.  Dad  <br>
  came over and we looked things  <br>
  over.  After dinner on my way  <br>
  back to the house, a small puffadder  <br>
  bit me on my third finger. I  <br>
  gave it first aid, then went home  <br>
  on the Motor bike, then Dad drove  <br>
  me to hospital, where I had anti-serum.  <br>
<br>
4th February 1938 Friday   <u>Cool. Cloudy.</u>  <br>
  Woke up at 2am this morning and could not   <br>
  get back to sleep. Nurse gave me   <br>
  sleeping powders but they did not help   <br>
  so I read till morning.  Nurses were    <br>
  nicer but mostly Afrikaans.  My hand a    <br>
  bit better.  Came home with Grandfather   <br>
  and went to bed again - still   <br>
  badly swollen - and going blue.   <br>
<br>
5th February 1938 Saturday  <u>Cool. Slightly Windy</u>  <br>
  Still laid up with my snake-bite: BUT    <br>
  I feel very much better today, in fact   <br>
  I got up and saw Allston off this morning.   <br>
  Had my meals in the dining room.   <br>
<br>
6th February 1938 Sunday     <u>Drizzle-heavy</u>   <br>
  Went over to Curries Drift in Terraplane   <br>
  with Dad.  Got stuck at foot of my   <br>
  hill.  Attended to work.  Still    <br>
  planting pines.   <br>
<br>
7th February 1938 Monday     <u>Drizzle</u>   <br>
  Dad went to Brinks to fetch Lemmons    <br>
  & orange trees, and on return journey    <br>
  to fetch Cecils goods from Martindale.    <br>
  In the afternoon we went to town    <br>
  in the Terraplane.  I went to the    <br>
  hospital for a few minutes to return     <br> 
  bandage. Scoured the town for    <br>
  a mag for Cecils Durant.    <br>
<br>
8th February 1938 Tuesday     <u>Very hot.</u>   <br>
  Left Comfort after an early breakfast   <br>
  and took the lorry with two 3/4 bags    <br>
  mealies and replacement of citrus    <br>
  to fill in where Valencia & Lemmon    <br>
  tress had died.  Took till Dinner    <br>
  to plant them.  Duced headache!    <br>
  In the afternoon <u>Long tick inspector</u>    <br>
  called.    <br>
