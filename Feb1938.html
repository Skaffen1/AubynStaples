<H1>Aubyn Warner Staples Diary</H1>
  Aged around 24 years old? <br>
<br>
This diary was written in 1938 in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.  <br>
Attitudes back then were very different, where these are offensive   <br>
I will try remove them but will try keep as much of the original     <br>
content as possible for the sake of authenticity.                    <br>
These views are NOT my own, I am trying to keep a bit of history alive.  <br>

1st February 1938 Tuesday     Hot.  <br>
  Planting pines. Pushing hard.  <br>
  Nothing of great interest has  <br>
  happened today.  Women   <br>
  are loafing badly.  James  <br>
  harrowed the mealies in   <br>
  the orchard.   <br>
<br>
2nd February 1938 Wednesday     Hot day. Slight rain PM.   <br>
  Still planting pines. Jacks oxen are <br>
  ploughing just ahead of the planting <br>
  and Jonash's oxen are riding on <br>
  plants.  I made a hard push <br>
  today.  In the afternoon I took the <br>
  tractor up to the land and ploughed <br>
  out the ends.  A heavy thunder <br>
  storm fell near Grahamstown  <br>
  but did not quite reach us. We   <br>
  got just enough to quit work.   <br>
  <u>3 boys from AGP!</u>  <br>
<br>
3rd February 1938 Thursday     Warm.  <br>
  Still planting pines as fast as I  <br>
  can - rushing in fact.  Dad  <br>
  came over and we looked things  <br>
  over.  After dinner on my way  <br>
  back to the house, a small puffadder  <br>
  bit me on my third finger. I  <br>
  gave it first aid, then went home  <br>
  on the Motor bike, then Dad drove  <br>
  me to hospital, where I had anti-serum  <br>
<br>
4th February 1938 Friday   <u>Cool. Cloudy.</u>
